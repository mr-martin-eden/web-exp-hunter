# Web Vulnerability Scanner

This simple bash script is designed to detect vulnerabilities on a target website, such as SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), insecure HTTP methods (PUT and DELETE), missing HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy), and LFI (Local File Inclusion). It also checks whether a specified port is open.


## Example
Please enter the target site URL (e.g., http://targetsite.com): http://example.com
Please enter the port number to scan: 80

[+] SQL Injection possibility detected!
[-] XSS vulnerability not detected.
[-] Insecure HTTP methods not detected.
[-] X-Frame-Options header is missing. The site may be vulnerable to clickjacking.
[-] X-XSS-Protection header is missing. The site may be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
[-] Content-Security-Policy header is missing. No security policy is in place.
[-] LFI vulnerability not detected.
[+] Port 80 is open and accessible.
